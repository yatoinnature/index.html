  <h2>The beginning</h2>

  <p>I have started fishing since i was 9 years old.
  <p>my dad took me to the paid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing" target="_balnk" title="fishing sepcification">
     fishing</a> lake and i caught my very first cat fishing.
  <p>the feeling delivered to my hand could not be forgotten.
  <p>since then, i always asked to dad to go fishing whenever it is possible
  <p>However, when i grew up, it stopped somehow.
  <p>my first genre of fishing was carp with float fishing using long stick shape to check wherther fishes take bite or not
  <p>the second genre is lake lure fishing. the fish called ssogari living in the widely in Korean lakes is main target.
  <p>after many years, i began to fish again but this time not with many dad but with friends
  <p>this time i learnt that not only fishing is fun but also begin to understand and feel the atomosphere given by the surrounding nature.
  <p>for 3 to 4 years, i went to ssogari fishing whenever i have some free time.
  <p>One time, a kin asked me to go octopus fishing. i never tried sea fishing before.
  <p>the distance from my home to sea is so far, and the cost of sea fishing is so high so i hesitate to go.
  <p>however, he persuaded me and i was on the bus to go Yosu.
  <p>the time i caught the octopus my fishing life is totaly changed.
  <p>from that time, i bought all differnet kinds of sea fishing gears and tries every genre of sea fishing from octopus to red sea bream.
  <p> in these days, i tried to learn cuttlefish. let us hope that i could be the master of cuttle fishing
